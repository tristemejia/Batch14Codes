Loops in Java:

while
do while
for
enhanced for loop/for each loop/ advanced for loop

for loop - when we know number of repetitions/ iterations in advance

for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {

    code to repeat;
}

while loop and do while -> if we dont know number of repetitions

while vs do while

while checks condition first-> then executes code
do while executes code -> then check condition

while(boolean condition) {
    code to repeat;
}

do {
    code to repeat;
}while(boolean condition);

---------------------------------

nested loops - loop inside another loop


for (int i=1; i<3; i++) { --> outer loop

    System.out.println("Hello");


    for(int j=1; j<=3; j++){ --> nested loop

        System.out.println("Bye");

    }
}
