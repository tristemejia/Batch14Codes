Type Casting(primitive data types):
Type casting is converting one data type to another one.
For example we can convert a short to byte a long to float etc.
There are two main types implicit/widening/automatic and
explicit/narrowing/Manual
Implicit/widening/automatic Type casting:
When java converts the data types automatically for us. It only
happens when we assign
a smaller data type to a larger data type, because there is no data
loss in this
Conversion.
Explicit/narrowing/Manual Type casting:
When we convert a larger data type to a smaller data type it is
called
Explicit/narrowing/Manual. it doesn't happen automatically. we have
to do it explicitly
Manually.
Why we should learn type casting?
When we write code in our real life most of the time we use the code
from others to save time and we might also need to convert the data
types to make
our code compatible with their code.
What is the syntax for type casting?
we use () and inside the () we write the destination data type for
example
if we want to convert a long to an int this is how we can do it.
long var1=250;
int var2=(int)var1; // its Explicit/narrowing/Manual
double var3=var2   //Implicit/widening/automatic
float f=250.5f;
double d=f;//Implicit/widening/automatic

============
If else conditions
If else conditions help us write code that can take the decision
based on data.
Why we should learn about if else?
Because when we are solving a real life problem like testing a Web
site our
Programs need to make a lot of decisions.
IF (the given username and password matches)
 {go to home page} ELSE {give user a warning}
 if (video freezing) {
System.out.println(âStop videoâ)}
else
{ System.out.println(âKeep Videoâ}
What is the syntax for If else conditions
boolean isHungry=true;
if(isHungry){
