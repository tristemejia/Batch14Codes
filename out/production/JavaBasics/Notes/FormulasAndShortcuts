formulas and shortcuts

Formula for even number is num%2==0
example int num1=0:
      if(num1%2==0){
         Syso->("number is even");
         }else{
         Syso->("number is odd");

short cut to bring scanner once typed ctrl+shift+o

Shortcut for autocomplete for main  ctrl+space

Format ctrl+shift+f

Scanner input formula is    Scanner fetch= new Scanner (System.in);

Main method   public static void main(String[] args);

scanner inputs String is scannername.next();, int is scannername.nextInt();
double is scannername.nextDouble();, char is scannername.next.charAt(0,1,2,);,
Example of completing a full string like first and last name  scannername.nextLine();

 \n    that is an escape charater which will create a new line like pressing enter
 
 \t        will put a tab space also an escape
 
 "\"       will show "" in println example   System.out.println("\" i love pizza\"");
 
 \\        i have to enter two backslash or else if i do one it will think im using an escape charater
 
 User input= Scanner. scan= new Scanner(System.in);
 
 to format code its ctrl+shift+f
 
 to ingore casing in nested inner box i can use .equalsIgnoreCase
 
 if i want to have double quotes within string heres example
  (" The \"fish\" is gold") its called an escape character
  works for backslashes also ("hello\\")

To find and just print a nuber to the power you use Syso(Math.pow(5, 2)); which would equal 25.0
and if you dont want it in a bouble format use int like Syso((int)Math.pow(5, 2));
and if i want to store it as a variable just take out the ()

String str = Arrays.deepToString(arr); to print all  arrays
and String str = Arrays.toString(arr

to find radius syntax is (3.14variablevariable)  or (Math.PI*Math.Pow(variable,2)
