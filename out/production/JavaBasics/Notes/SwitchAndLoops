switch syntax

 switch (variable) {

  case value1:
              code A;
              break;
  case value2:
              code B;
              break;
  default:
              code C;
              break;
 }

 Limitations:
         data type: CANNOT work with double, float, long, boolean

         operators: CANNOT work with logical and relational

Loops -

System.out.println("good morning");
System.out.println("good morning");
System.out.println("good morning");
System.out.println("good morning");
System.out.println("good morning");


    int time=10;

    if (time<12) {

        System.out.println("good morning");
    }

    while (time<12) {

        System.out.println("good morning");

    }

while loop syntax

while(boolean condition) {

    code to be repeated;

}

do while loop syntax

do {
    code to be repeated;

}while(boolean condition);

while vs do while --> both loops executed while condition is true

while loop first CHECK condition -> if true -> executes code
do while first EXECUTES code --> then checks condition

for loop syntax

for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {

    code to be repeated;
}

// Hello 5 times

for (int i=1; i<=5 ; i++) {
    System.out.println("Hello");
}

When to use which loop:

When we know in advance how many times to repeat block of code -> USE FOR LOOP

when we do  not know in advance how many times to repeat block of code -> USE WHILE OR DO WHILE
