STLC

1:Requirment/analyse, SmMART criteria specific,measureble,attainable, relevent, time base


Test planning- what when how who when  prepared by test lead

Test case Development
amazon.com - Production Enviroment
Dev.amazon.com- Develover enviroment, where developers make code
Test.amazon.com- QA Tester Enviroment, where tester do test
Stage.amazon.com - like a trial page where real user test it.(UAT user acceptance testing) then it goes to production

There are 2 types of testing 1)Funcional 2) non fuctional

Fuctional- to check the fuctioality of the application

Non Fuctional- backend testing

Regression testing testing all the completed funtionality/all the test cases

only Developers do unit/component testing.

QA tester we perform the integration testing/ test fuctionality

regression tests all the scenarios

system testing- test everything front to end. smoke test
SDLC (Software developement Cycle)

Software - a machine readable code or program that tells computers how to perform or do its task
Hardware- is physical like screen, monitors,keyboards & things that you can touch.


SDLC phases
1.Planning - it is marketable, return of investment, probability of achievement and success,is there a demand.


2. Analysis- a business analyst meets w/ clients and takes all the detailed "requirements" which are
fine details of info. they also talk to "end users" about the process that they will be using at the most.
Stakeholders and all the people involved as well as domain experts, coders & developers who have already buildt
a similar code, program or app.


3. Design- designs networks, app architect, user interface, system interface, database, prototypes and system controls.
they are the designers & architect of the project or software being developed.they build the blueprints to support the system
for its primary goals. goals that are current and for the future.


4.Implementation/development-  this is where all the construction workers/ coders start to build. They bring the designed plan
 into life. they also create the database and install the hardware and software to make everything work


 5. Requirement/testing- This is where we come in. we are the inspects  trying to find all the bugs and ways to break the system
 of code so we can send back to the developer to improve and fix the bug. we verify the the coding is good and ready to go


 6.Maintenance- self explained its to maintain and observe the perform for short term to keep it up to date.
